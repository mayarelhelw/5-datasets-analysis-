📊 Multi-Dataset Consumer & Market Analysis with Python
🧠 Overview
This repository contains four Python notebooks analyzing diverse datasets across retail, automotive, real estate, and consumer behavior. Each notebook includes data cleaning, visualization, and actionable insights tailored to the nature of the dataset.

📁 Notebooks Included
🛍️ 1. Shopping Trends Analysis
Focus: Age group segmentation, gender-based spending, item distribution, and price variance.

Techniques: Bar charts, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps.

Insights: Females tend to purchase higher-priced items; all items show price variance; age has weak correlation with spending.

🚗 2. Used Cars Market Analysis
Focus: Price trends by brand, mileage impact, fuel type comparison, and regional pricing.

Techniques: Box plots, histograms, regression lines.

Insights: Mileage and fuel type significantly affect pricing; some brands retain value better than others.

🛒 3. Supermarket Sales Analysis
Focus: Product category performance, seasonal trends, customer segmentation.

Techniques: Time series plots, pie charts, grouped bar charts.

Insights: Certain categories peak seasonally; loyalty programs impact repeat purchases.

🏠 4. London Housing Market Analysis
Focus: Price distribution by borough, property type comparison, correlation with crime and schools.

Techniques: Heatmaps, geospatial plots, scatter matrices.

Insights: Location and property type are key drivers; weak correlation with review ratings or age.
